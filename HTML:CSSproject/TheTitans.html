    <div id="content">
      <p>While there is no direct defintion of the word Titans and what it means in Ancient Greek Theogony,
      the best guess that we have made is based on a Greek root word that losely means, "Over-Reacher".
      Ouranos gave them this name because they went to far (Reached over/past the boundaries) by taking
      control of the world. Below is a list of some of the most important Titans.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Themis - One of the earliest known titans, she represents the natural orer of things, or law
        and order. The direct translation to English is "Right".</li>
      </ul>
        <img src="Themis.jpeg" alt="Themis" />
      <ul>
        <li>Okeanos - Means Ocean, the water that circled the world. She is extremely fertile. The Greeks
        believed that the edge of the 'disk of Earth' was made up of Ocean.</li>
      </ul>
        <img src="Okeanus.jpeg" alt="Okeanos" />
      <ul>
        <li>Pheobe - Light, Shining (She is the god that finally brings light to the time of day)</li>
      </ul>
        <img src="Pheobe.jpeg" alt="Pheobe" />
      <ul>
        <li>Kronos - He is a shapeshifter.</li>
      </ul>
        <img src="Kronos.jpeg" alt="Kronos" />
      <ul>
        <li>Atlas - Has no real significance yet.</li>
      </ul>
        <img src="Atlas.jpeg" alt="Atlas" />
      <ul>
        <li>Rhea - Like her mother in regards to being an Earth goddess type but she is not as smart as her
        mother. Very attractive, possibly more so than her mother.</li>
      </ul>
        <img src="Rhea.jpeg" alt="Rhea" />
