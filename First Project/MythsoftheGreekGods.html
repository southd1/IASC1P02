    <h1>The Myths of the Greek Gods</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>Before we begin to look at the myths of the Greek Gods, here is a few helpful terms that one should know:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anthropos - Person</li>
      <li>Morphe - Form</li>
      <li>Anthropomorphism - Human Form</li>
      <li>Allegory - The idea that a myth represents a bigger idea about human behavior and social rights.</li>
      <li>Immanent - A god that exists within the creation of the world. The greek gods would be a perfect example of this.</li>
      <li>Transcendent - A god that exists outside of the creation of the world. The catholic god would be a perfect example of this.</li>
      <li>Providence - Foresight; A predesigned plan. A transcedent god will have a plan whereas an immanent god will not.</li>
      <li>Parthenogenetically - To reproduce by oneself.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h3>And now, the story begins...</h3>
    <p>The world started out with five gods born out of spontaneous generation, meaning they came into existance without any explanation or instigation. The five gods are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gaia - Gaia is the Anthropomorphic representation of the Earth.</li>
      <li>Tartaros - The Anthropomorphic representation of the Underworld.</li>
      <li>Eros - The Anthropomorphic representation of the force of attraction.</li>
      <li>Erebos - The Anthropomorphic representation of the darkness.</li>
      <li>Nyx - The Anthropomorphic representation of the night.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Ancient Greeks believed that the Earth was flat at this time, so to view the world as they did, picture two
    flat circular disks. One is the Earth and far below that(Not touching) is the Underworld. It was always night time
    and it was always dark. According to Hesiod, often times the result of sexual intercourse is the opposite of the
    parents' personality, which is why when Erebos and Myx mutually agreed to reproduce, they gave birth to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hemera - The Anrothpomorphic form of day (referring to time of day, not the light of day).</li>
      <li>Aither - Brightness</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Meanwhile, Gaia parthenogenically reproduced:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ouranos - The Anthropomorphic representation of the sky.</li>
      <li>Pontos - The Anthropomorphic representation of water. (Streams, lakes, rivers, small bodies of water)</li>
      <li>Oros - The Anthropomorphic represenation of the mountains.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So now, looking back at the diagram previously mentioned above, the top disk (Earth) has small bodies of water
    running through it as well as mountains taking form. A new disk has been added, Ouranos, which is laying right on
    top of Gaia. Ouranos, being so close in proximaty to his mother, starts to rape her which creates the
    <a href="file:///Users/Desiree/Desktop/University/Year%20%231/Semester%20%231/IASC%201P02%20-%20Web%20Design/First%20Project/TheTitans.html">Titans</a>.
    <a name="Back" />Ouranos continues raping Gaia which produces Cyclopes (Cyclops), and three Hekatoncheires (Hundred Handlers) named
    Kottos, Briareus and Gyges (The Elemental powers of the lower Earth), all of which had 100 arms and 50 heads. Below
    is an image of how the hekatonkheire was believed to have looked.</p>

    <p>Gaia doesn’t like being raped and calls out for help but her only child who came to help was Kronos. Gaia produces
    a Steel Sickle (A wheat farming tool) and gives it to Kronos who uses it to cut of Ouranos’ genitals. They go flying
    through the air, bleeding as they go and when the drops of blood land on Gaia they create Erinyes (Furies, Goddesses
    of Vengeance), Gigantes (Giants) and Ash Tree Nymphs. Since Ouranos’ genitals were the only thing keeping him attached
    to Gaia, he floated upwards and now, thinking back to the disk theory, we have three disks, none of which are touching
    and all evenly spaced. Ouranos’s genitals landed in the water which started to foam, not long after emerged Aphrodite,
    The goddess of pleasure and procreation. Now that Gaia is free from Ouranos, she starts to mate with her other child,
    Pontos, which creates the sea dieties. Nyx also starts reproducing parthenogenetically resulting in the birth of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Moros - Doom</li>
      <li>Thanatos - Death</li>
      <li>Hypnos - Sleep</li>
      <li>Eris - Strife, Dis-attraction, Opposite of Eros</li>
      <li> The Moirai - Specifically direct the fate of one's life:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Klotho - Spinner</li>
          <li>Lachesis - Measurer</li>
          <li>Atropos - Cutter</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
