      <h3>A Brief History of Muggle Awareness of Fantastic Beast</h3>
        <p>Astonishing though it may seem to many wizards, Muggles have not always been ignorant of the magical
        and monstrous creatures that we have worked so long and hard to hide. A glance through Muggle art and
        literature of the Middle Ages reveals that many of the creatures they now believe to be imaginary were
        then known to be real. The dragon, the griffin, the unicorn, the phoenix, the centaur - these and more
        are represented in Muggle works of that period, though usually with almost comical inexactitude.</p>
        <p>However, a closer examination of Muggle bestiaries of that period demonstrates that most magical beasts
        either escaped Muggles notice completely or were mistaken for something else. Examine this surviving
        fragment of manuscript, written by one Brother Benedict, a Franiscan monk from Worcestershire:</p>
        <p>Todaye while travailing in the Herbe Garden, I did push aside the basil to discover a Ferret of monstrous
        size. It did not run nor hide as Ferrets are wont to do, but leapt upon me, throwing me backwards upon the
        grounde and crying with most unnatural fury, 'Get out it, Baldy!' It did then bite my nose so viciously that
        I did bleed for several Hours. The Friar was unwillinge to believe that I had met a talking Ferret and did ask
        me whether I had been supping of Brother Boniface's Turnip Wine. As my nose was still swollen and bloody I was
        excused Vespers.</p>
        <p>Evidently our Muggle friend had unearthed not a ferret, as he supposed, but a Jarvey, most likely in
        pursuit of its favourite prey, gnomes.</p>
        <p>Imperfect understanding is often more dangerous that ignorance, and the Muggles' fear of magic was
        undoubtedly increased by their dread of what might be lurking in their herb gardens. Muggle persecution of
        wizards at this time was reaching a pitch hitherto unknown and sightings of such beasts as dragons and
        Hippogriffs were contributing to Muggle hysteria.</p>
